# Vision & Goals

## Vision Statement

To create the definitive cross-platform release automation tool that unifies version management, changelog generation, and package publishing across all major package ecosystems, enabling developers to maintain consistent release workflows regardless of their technology stack.

## Primary Goals

1. **Unify release workflows** across npm, Cargo, PyPI, Maven, Go modules, NuGet, Docker, and app stores
2. **Support multiple versioning strategies** (SemVer, CalVer, build numbers, hybrid)
3. **Provide extensible plugin architecture** for custom workflows
4. **Enable monorepo support** with coordinated or independent versioning
5. **Maintain high reliability** with dry-run capabilities and rollback support
6. **Integrate seamlessly** with popular CI/CD systems

## Success Criteria

| Criteria | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Ecosystem support | Successfully replace existing release tools in at least 3 different ecosystems |
| Monorepo scale | Support monorepo projects with 10+ packages |
| Performance | Sub-second performance for version calculation and changelog generation |
| Extensibility | Plugin architecture allowing community extensions |
| Documentation | Comprehensive documentation and migration guides from existing tools |

## Target Users

- **Polyglot developers** working across multiple language ecosystems
- **DevOps engineers** managing release pipelines for diverse projects
- **Monorepo maintainers** needing coordinated releases across packages
- **Open source maintainers** wanting consistent release automation
- **Platform teams** standardizing release workflows across an organization
