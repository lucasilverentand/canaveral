# iOS Certificates

iOS apps must be signed with a valid certificate to run on devices or be submitted to the App Store.

## Certificate Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Development | Run on development devices |
| Distribution | App Store and TestFlight |
| Ad Hoc | Beta testing outside TestFlight |
| Enterprise | Internal distribution |

## Using Match

The recommended way to manage certificates is with Canaveral's match command:

```bash
canaveral match init --storage git --git-url git@github.com:org/certs.git --team-id TEAMID
canaveral match sync --profile-type development
canaveral match sync --profile-type appstore
```

See [Match (Sync)](/canaveral/signing/match/) for details.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer manual certificate management:

1. Create certificate in Apple Developer Portal
2. Download and install in Keychain
3. Configure in `canaveral.yaml`:

```yaml
signing:
  enabled: true
  provider: macos
  identity: "Apple Distribution: Your Company (TEAMID)"
```
