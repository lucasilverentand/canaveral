# What is Canaveral?

Canaveral is a **unified launch system for software** -- a single Rust CLI that replaces the patchwork of turborepo, tuist, release-please, semantic-release, fastlane, goreleaser, and similar tools. It handles the full lifecycle: build orchestration, smart test selection, release management, publishing, app store distribution, and marketing material generation.

Named after **Cape Canaveral**, NASA's historic launch site -- we launch software.

<Aside type="tip">
  Unlike fastlane which focuses primarily on native iOS/Android, Canaveral is **framework-agnostic** and provides a unified interface for Flutter, Expo, React Native, native iOS/Android, Tauri, Electron, Vite, Next.js, Astro, and more.

## Why Canaveral?

### The Problem

Mobile app development typically requires managing multiple tools:

- **fastlane** for iOS builds and distribution
- **Gradle** or custom scripts for Android
- **Framework-specific CLIs** (Flutter, Expo, etc.)
- **Custom CI/CD configurations** that vary by platform
- **Manual certificate management** that causes team friction

This fragmentation leads to:
- Duplicated configuration across platforms
- Inconsistent CI/CD pipelines
- Steep learning curves for each tool
- Certificate and signing chaos

### The Solution

Canaveral provides **one unified interface** for all mobile app operations:

```bash
# Same command works for all frameworks
canaveral build --platform ios --profile release
canaveral build --platform android --profile release

# One tool for all distribution targets
canaveral testflight upload build/ios/App.ipa
canaveral publish google-play --artifact build/android/app.aab --track internal

# Unified certificate management
canaveral match sync --profile-type appstore
```

## Comparison with Existing Tools

| Feature | Canaveral | Fastlane | Bitrise |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Framework support | All major | Native focus | Step-based |
| Language | Rust (fast) | Ruby | Go |
| Configuration | YAML or TOML | Ruby DSL | YAML |
| CI/CD output | JSON, structured | Text | JSON |
| Certificate sync | Built-in | Via match | External |
| Monorepo support | Built-in (task DAG, caching) | Limited | External |
| Learning curve | Low | Medium | Low |

## Architecture

Canaveral is a Rust workspace with 10 focused crates:

```
canaveral              # CLI binary (clap). Entry point, command routing, output formatting.
├── canaveral-core          # Config loading (YAML/TOML), hook system, plugin registry,
│                           # monorepo workspace detection, workflow orchestration, CI/CD templates.
├── canaveral-git           # Git operations via git2. Commit parsing, tag management, remote ops.
├── canaveral-changelog     # Conventional commit parsing, changelog generation, formatters.
├── canaveral-strategies    # Version calculation. SemVer, CalVer, build numbers. Pluggable.
├── canaveral-adapters      # Package manager integrations (npm, Cargo, Python, Go, Maven, Docker).
├── canaveral-frameworks    # Build/test adapters (Flutter, React Native, Vite, Next.js, Astro,
│                           # Tauri, Electron, native iOS, native Android).
├── canaveral-signing       # Code signing providers (macOS, Windows, Android, GPG). Match-style sync.
├── canaveral-stores        # Uploaders for app stores and registries (App Store Connect, Google Play,
│                           # Microsoft Store, npm, crates.io).
├── canaveral-metadata      # App store metadata management, validation, Fastlane-compatible layout.
└── canaveral-tasks         # Task orchestration: pipeline DAG, parallel execution, caching.
```

Each layer follows a trait-based adapter pattern, ensuring consistent behavior and easy extensibility.
