# What is Canaveral?

Canaveral is a **universal release management CLI** designed to replace the fragmented ecosystem of package-specific release tools (fastlane, release-please, semantic-release, etc.) with a single, extensible solution that works across multiple frameworks and platforms.

Named after **Cape Canaveral**, NASA's historic launch site, Canaveral reflects the tool's mission to "launch" software releases to their target registries with precision and reliability.

<Aside type="tip">
  Unlike fastlane which focuses primarily on native iOS/Android, Canaveral is **framework-agnostic** and provides a unified interface for Flutter, Expo, React Native, native Swift/Kotlin, Tauri, and more.

## Why Canaveral?

### The Problem

Mobile app development typically requires managing multiple tools:

- **fastlane** for iOS builds and distribution
- **Gradle** or custom scripts for Android
- **Framework-specific CLIs** (Flutter, Expo, etc.)
- **Custom CI/CD configurations** that vary by platform
- **Manual certificate management** that causes team friction

This fragmentation leads to:
- Duplicated configuration across platforms
- Inconsistent CI/CD pipelines
- Steep learning curves for each tool
- Certificate and signing chaos

### The Solution

Canaveral provides **one unified interface** for all mobile app operations:

```bash
# Same command works for all frameworks
canaveral build --platform ios --profile release
canaveral build --platform android --profile release

# One tool for all distribution targets
canaveral testflight upload build/ios/App.ipa
canaveral store upload android --artifact build/android/app.aab

# Unified certificate management
canaveral match sync --profile-type appstore
```

## Comparison with Existing Tools

| Feature | Canaveral | Fastlane | Bitrise |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Framework support | All major | Native focus | Step-based |
| Language | Rust (fast) | Ruby | Go |
| Configuration | TOML | Ruby DSL | YAML |
| CI/CD output | JSON, structured | Text | JSON |
| Certificate sync | Built-in | Via match | External |
| Learning curve | Low | Medium | Low |

## Architecture

Canaveral is built with a modular architecture:

```
canaveral-cli        # Command-line interface
├── canaveral-frameworks   # Build adapters for each framework
├── canaveral-stores       # Store distribution (App Store, Play Store)
├── canaveral-signing      # Certificate and profile management
└── canaveral-core        # Shared utilities
```

Each framework adapter implements a common interface, ensuring consistent behavior across all supported platforms.
