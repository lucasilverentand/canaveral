# App Store Connect

Upload and distribute iOS apps to the App Store.

## Authentication

Canaveral uses App Store Connect API keys for authentication. No Apple ID/password required.

### Generate API Key

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api)
2. Click "Generate API Key"
3. Select "App Manager" role
4. Download the .p8 file

### Configure

```bash
export APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID="XXXXXXXXXX"
export APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
export APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH="/path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8"
```

## Upload via TestFlight

The recommended flow is to upload via TestFlight first:

```bash
# Upload IPA to TestFlight
canaveral testflight upload build/ios/MyApp.ipa

# With changelog
canaveral testflight upload build/ios/MyApp.ipa --changelog "New features"
```

## Publish to App Store

```bash
# Submit to App Store Connect
canaveral publish apple --artifact build/ios/MyApp.ipa
```

## Metadata Management

```bash
# Initialize metadata directory
canaveral metadata init

# Validate metadata against App Store requirements
canaveral metadata validate

# Sync metadata with App Store
canaveral metadata sync

# Preview changes
canaveral metadata diff
```
