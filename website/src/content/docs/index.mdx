## Why Canaveral?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Framework Agnostic" icon="puzzle">
    Build Flutter, Expo, React Native, native iOS/Android, and Tauri apps with the same commands. No more learning different tools for each framework.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CI/CD First" icon="rocket">
    Designed for automation from day one. JSON output, GitHub Actions integration, and structured errors make CI/CD pipelines reliable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Match-style Signing" icon="shield">
    Sync certificates and profiles across your team with encrypted storage in Git, S3, or Azure. Never deal with signing issues again.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fast & Native" icon="star">
    Written in Rust for speed and reliability. No Ruby runtime, no dependency conflicts, just a single binary that works everywhere.
  </Card>

## Coming from Fastlane?

Canaveral provides equivalent functionality with a simpler, more consistent interface:

| Fastlane | Canaveral |
|----------|-----------|
| `gym` | `canaveral build --platform ios` |
| `gradle` | `canaveral build --platform android` |
| `pilot` | `canaveral testflight upload` |
| `deliver` | `canaveral upload ios` |
| `supply` | `canaveral upload android` |
| `match` | `canaveral match sync` |
| `snapshot` | `canaveral screenshots capture` |
