# Exit Codes

Canaveral uses standard Unix exit codes:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Error (command failed, tests failed, build failed, etc.) |

All errors are reported through stderr with descriptive messages. Use `--verbose` for detailed error output, or `--format json` for machine-readable error information.

## Common Error Scenarios

| Scenario | Exit Code | Example Message |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Build succeeded | 0 | - |
| Tests passed | 0 | - |
| Build failed | 1 | "Build failed: ..." |
| Tests failed | 1 | "Tests failed: 3 passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped" |
| Task execution failed | 1 | "2 tasks failed" |
| PR validation failed | 1 | "PR validation failed" |
| Configuration not found | 1 | "No workspace found in current directory" |
| Missing path | 1 | "Path not found: ..." |
| No packages found | 1 | "No packages found in workspace" |
